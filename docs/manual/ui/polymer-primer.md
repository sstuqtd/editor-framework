# Polymer Primer

Editor-Framework provides a way to use [Polymer](polymer-project.org) for ui programming. This doc is for crediting Polymer as the perfect UI system solution for building a complex game editor toolset. Also we'd like to point to some core polymer documentation that will help you get started with developing an app with the Editor-Framework.

## Polymer Elements

Polymer has an official elements library called [Catalog](https://elements.polymer-project.org/). You can browse through the library, see demo of elements and read their documentation.

If you'd like to use some of them in your app, simply install them with bower and import the element's html file into your template.
