Editor Framework gives you power to easily write professional multi-panel desktop software in HTML5 and node.js.

The framework is based on top of [Electron](http://github.com/atom/electron) ~~and [Polymer](http://github.com/polymer/polymer)~~(Polymer will be removed soon, and editor-framework will be unlimited for any gui framework).
It is designed conforming to Electron’s [main and renderer process architecture](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/quick-start.md).
To make multiple windows communicate easily, Editor Framework extends [Electron’s IPC message API](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/api/ipc-renderer.md), making it easier to send and receive callbacks between the main and renderer processes.

It is designed for full extensibility. In the core level (main process), we achieve this by introducing a package management module and several registration APIs. The user can load or unload packages on the fly without closing or restarting the app. In the page level (renderer process), we use HTML5 Web Component standards and include the Polymer solution by default. The user can extend the widgets and panels, then refresh the page to apply the changes.

## Prerequisite

- Install [node.js v0.12+](https://nodejs.org/) or [node.js v4.0+](https://nodejs.org)
- Install [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) command line tool
- Install [bower](http://bower.io/) command line tool

```bash
npm install -g bower gulp
```

For **Windows** user, you need the following environment set up to be able to build nodejs native modules:

- [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp)
- [Visual Studio Community 2013](http://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs)
- [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) - make sure you can run `python --version` in your command line tool. Read [this](https://docs.python.org/2/using/windows.html#excursus-setting-environment-variables) for setting up path correctly.

## Install

In cloned project folder, run the following command to setup dev environment:

```bash
# Initialize gulp task dependencies
# npm is a builtin CLI when you install Node.js
npm install
```

### Install With NPM

You can also install Editor Framework into your app as a npm package:

```bash
# Again, npm script will take care of other dependencies
npm install cocos-creator/editor-framework
```

**NOTE:** after npm dependencies are installed, we will run `node-gyp rebuild` against all native modules in editor-framework path. Please make sure `node-gyp` works in your command line environment. To learn more about native module building and setting up a `node-gyp` working environment, please check out:

- [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp)
- [Build native module for electron](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/using-native-node-modules.md)
- [native-module for beginner](https://github.com/Elzair/native-module)

### Choose Electron Download Mirror

Download Electron can take time, especially when you're on the wrong side of wall. We use [electron-prebuilt](https://github.com/mafintosh/electron-prebuilt) for Electron binary download. You can choose if you want to use the china mirror during `gulp update-electron` task.

The first time you run this task (this task is included in `npm install` process), you'll be asked if you want to use China mirror for Electron downloading. A json file `mirror-setting.json` will be created to record your choice, like this:

```js
// local-setting.json
{
  "mirror": "china" // this value can be 'china' or 'global'
                    // depending on your answer
}
```

You can change this file anytime to choose mirror for Electron downloading again.

## Run Editor-Framework Demo

```bash
npm start
```

In the demo you will see builtin packages and other example packages from `Developer` and `Examples` menu.

## Builtin Packages

The `gulp install-builtin` will install these builtin packages (this operation is covered in the npm install script):

 - Developer Tools
   - [console](https://github.com/fireball-packages/console)
   - [ipc-debugger](https://github.com/fireball-packages/ipc-debugger)
   - [package-manager](https://github.com/fireball-packages/package-manager)
   - [tester](https://github.com/fireball-packages/tester)
 - Widgets
   - [ui-kit](https://github.com/fireball-packages/ui-kit)
   - [pixi-grid](https://github.com/fireball-packages/pixi-grid)

## Update

To get the latest fireball build:

```bash
# Update editor-framework from github repo,
# also update builtin packages and electron binary
# this command will also check dependencies
# and report outdated or missing dependencies
gulp update

# If you want to update all dependencies
# this command will bootstrap and update the whole project and takes long
npm install

# or if you just want to quickly install a missing package:
# please use the semver reported at the end of `gulp update` dependency check
npm install some-npm-package@x.x.x

# If you only want to update bower dependencies
bower install
```

## Develop

### Test Environment

 - Mocha
 - Chai
 - Sinon

**Note:** We need to install Mocha, Chai in both core and page; that’s why we put them in both Bower and npm dependencies. The core-level tests only run during the development phase, and will not go into the final product. The page-level test environment has integrated with the [tester](https://github.com/fireball-packages/tester) package and every developer can use it to test your panels.

To test the editor-framework itself, just run:

```bash
npm test
```

You can also run a single test or a bunch of tests in one directory by:

```bash
npm start -- test ${your/test/path}
```

You can also force to run tests in renderer by `--renderer` option:

```bash
npm start -- test --renderer ${your/test/path}
```

You can load specific package and run its tests by `--package` option:

```bash
npm start -- test --package ${your/test/path}
```

To debug a test, use the `--detail` option:

```bash
npm start -- test --detail ${your/test/path}
```

### Generate Documentation

To generate the document, just run:

```bash
npm run api
```

It will generate the API document in `./apidocs`, you can browse it by open `./apidocs/index.html`.
