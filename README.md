Editor Framework gives you power to easily write professional multi-panel desktop software in HTML5 and io.js.

The framework is based on top of [Electron](http://github.com/atom/electron) and [Polymer](http://github.com/polymer/polymer).
It is designed conforming to Electron’s [main and renderer process architecture](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/quick-start.md).
To make multiple windows communicate easily, Editor Framework extends [Electron’s IPC message API](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/api/ipc-renderer.md), making it easier to send and receive callbacks between the main and renderer processes.

It is designed for full extensibility. In the core level (main process), we achieve this by introducing a package management module and several registration APIs. The user can load or unload packages on the fly without closing or restarting the app. In the page level (renderer process), we use HTML5 Web Component standards and include the Polymer solution by default. The user can extend the widgets and panels, then refresh the page to apply the changes.

## Install

There are two ways to install and bootstrap Editor Framework:

### Clone This Repo

Enter your repo’s folder, then run the following command:

```bash
# Install npm packages, the npm script will take care of other dependencies
npm install
```

### Install With NPM

You can also install Editor Framework into your app as a npm package:

```bash
# Again, npm script will take care of other dependencies
npm install editor-framework
```

**NOTE:** after npm dependencies are installed, we will run `node-gyp rebuild` against all native modules in editor-framework path. Please make sure `node-gyp` works in your command line environment. To learn more about native module building and setting up a `node-gyp` working environment, please check out:

- [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp)
- [Build native module for electron](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/using-native-node-modules.md)
- [native-module for beginner](https://github.com/Elzair/native-module)

### Choose Electron Download Mirror

Download Electron can take time, especially when you're on the wrong side of wall. We use [electron-prebuilt](https://github.com/mafintosh/electron-prebuilt) for Electron binary download. You can choose if you want to use the china mirror during `gulp update-electron` task.

The first time you run this task (this task is included in `npm install` process), you'll be asked if you want to use China mirror for Electron downloading. A json file `mirror-setting.json` will be created to record your choice, like this:

```js
//mirror-setting.json
{
    "mirror": "china" // this value can be 'china' or 'global'
                      // depending on your answer
}
```

You can change this file anytime to choose mirror for Electron downloading again.

## Run Editor-Framework Demo

```bash
npm start
```

In the demo you will see builtin packages and other example packages from `Developer` and `Examples` menu.

## Builtin Packages

The `gulp install-builtin` will install these builtin packages (this operation is covered in the npm install script):

 - Developer Tools
   - [console](https://github.com/fireball-packages/console)
   - [ipc-debugger](https://github.com/fireball-packages/ipc-debugger)
   - [package-manager](https://github.com/fireball-packages/package-manager)
   - [tester](https://github.com/fireball-packages/tester)
 - Widgets
   - [ui-kit](https://github.com/fireball-packages/ui-kit)
   - [pixi-grid](https://github.com/fireball-packages/pixi-grid)

## Update

```bash
# update builtin packages and shared packages
npm run update
```

## Develop

### Test Environment

 - Mocha
 - Chai
 - Sinon

**Note:** We need to install Mocha, Chai in both core and page; that’s why we put them in both Bower and npm dependencies. The core-level tests only run during the development phase, and will not go into the final product. The page-level test environment has integrated with the [tester](https://github.com/fireball-x/tester) package and every developer can use it to test your panels.

To test the editor-framework itself, just run:

```bash
npm test
```

### Generate Documentation

To generate the document, just run:

```bash
npm run api-core # for core-level docs
npm run api-page # for page-level docs
```
